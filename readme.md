environment:

->custom env using gynasium and pybullet

->using rocket.urdf as rocket model and using landing.urdf for the model of the landing pad

neural_netowrk_model:

->using stable baselines 3 for neural netowrk

    stable baselines is libary which is used for reliable implementaion of
    reinforcement learning algorithms .

    Also supports tensorboard which is used to monitor the performance of the RL algorithm.

->using ppo(proximal policy optimization) Rl algorithm
